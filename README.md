# Client and server example

This example shows a simple client and server.

The server writes "Hello world" to the client(s) every second, and the client can send whatever inputs.

To run the example, start the server:

    $ ./build
    $ ./server

The server includes a simple web client. To use the client, open
http://localhost:8080 in the browser and follow the instructions on the page.
